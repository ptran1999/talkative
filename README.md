Current Progress

  -We have completed a basic GUI for the main messenger
  
  -We have completed a basic GUI for the login and register
  
  -We have a local database working with a user table
  
  -We have the login and register connected to the database and error checks and adds in new users to the table
  
  -We have a main chat room that is visible to all connected user of which messages can be seen between users.
  
  
Future Plans

  -We are currently trying to connect to a cloud server for the database
  
  -We are also currently trying to connect the login and register executable to the main GUI
  
  -We are then trying to make a friends list
  
  -We will also create the ability to find users to add to the friends list
  
  -We are also going to make it so we can connect 2 users individually to each other.
  

This is where we will be done with the major parts of the project, we plan on arriving here by the start of July. After this we will attempt to add other additional functions to the project such as:


  -Make a message history between individual users
  
  -Add customization settings such as background colors
  
  -Make users have profile pictures
  
  -Add timestamps to messages
  
  -Add deletion option for messages
  
  -Add the ability to see who is online
